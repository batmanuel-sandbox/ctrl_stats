The objects in this directory represent records in which are parsed from
HTCondor and DAGMAN logs.   The format of the records that each of these
emit is very regular, and the parsing code for these objects is HIGHLY 
dependent on this.  See individual objects for additional information about
what each object expects.  The header for all records is parsed.  Some records
contain additional information we're interested in, and those records are
parsed in more detail.
